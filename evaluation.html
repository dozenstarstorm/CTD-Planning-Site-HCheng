<h1>Reviewing success criteria</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1). The logo fits 1/10 of the front page and can still be visible.</li>
  <li>2). The slideshow is working and it does not contrast badly with the background color.</li>
  <li>3). The design and typography of the font fit the style of the photography studio.</li>
  <li>4). Make sure usable and relevant content is put on instead of a block of words.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1). The logo is minimized to the top right corner of the page and can be linked back to the index page.</li>
  <li>2). The slideshow is ruled out due to time restraints and insufficent skills. Our photos match with the formal background.</li>
  <li>3). The design doesn't really match the timelessness of this old photography studio because it is a grey background and gives a modern outlook.</li>
  <li>4). The buttons' functions are still under construction and the heritage slide seems to have too much words.</li>
</ul>
